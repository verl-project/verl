Agent Loop
==========

Last updated: 08/27/2026.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   [status: alpha]

.. warning::
   Agent Loop is ready for use, but the API may change in future releases.

Agent Loop is designed as general interface for multi-turn rollout and agentic reinforcement learning.

**Design goal**:

- Plugable user defined agent loop
- Provide standard request generate api with different inference frameworks
- Provide request level load balance between multiple inference servers

**Non-goal**:

- How tool is defined and how to call tool

In high level overview, agent loop is given a prompt, run user defined loop: call LLM generate api, call tools, ...
and return the final output. The final output is then calculated reward and used as trajectory for RL training.

API Design
----------

``AgentLoopBase`` class is the abstraction of agent loop, and ``run`` method is the only interface that user need to implement.
The run method, given prompt messages in format: [{"role": "user"}, {"content": "..."}], and additional sampling params,
could do whatever user wants, such as

- call LLM generate api
- call tools: web search, database query, code sandbox, ...
- environment interaction
- reflection
- ...

.. code:: python

   class AgentLoopBase(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       async def run(
           self, sampling_params: dict[str, Any], **kwargs
       ) -> AgentLoopOutput | list[AgentLoopOutput]:
           """Run agent loop to interact with LLM server and environment.

           Args:
               sampling_params (Dict[str, Any]): LLM sampling params.
               **kwargs: dataset fields from `verl.utils.dataset.RLHFDataset`.

           Returns:
               AgentLoopOutput | list[AgentLoopOutput]: One output for a regular
                   trajectory, or an ordered list of outputs for multiple training
                   segments belonging to the same logical trajectory.
           """
           raise NotImplementedError

After running the user-defined loop, ``run`` should return an ``AgentLoopOutput``
including prompt token ids, response token ids, and response mask. The V1
TransferQueue adapter also accepts an ordered list of ``AgentLoopOutput`` values.
It writes each value as a separate training row, computes the reward from the
last value, and broadcasts the final output's GRPO advantage to all values in
the same logical trajectory. The legacy batch adapter intentionally keeps the
single-output contract.

.. code:: python

   class AgentLoopOutput(BaseModel):
       """Agent loop output."""

       prompt_ids: list[int]
       """Prompt token ids."""
       response_ids: list[int]
       """Response token ids including LLM generated token, tool response token."""
       response_mask: list[int]
       """Response mask, 1 for LLM generated token, 0 for tool response token."""
       loss_weight: Optional[float] = None
       """Optional positive multiplier for this output's policy-gradient loss."""

``loss_weight`` is optional and defaults to neutral ``1.0``. It is an explicit
positive policy-gradient multiplier that the rollout adapters pass through
unchanged; padding rows with no valid response tokens are zeroed. The weight is
applied only to the policy-gradient term; it does not modify critic returns,
entropy regularization, or KL regularization.

.. warning::
   The weight needed to make a split trajectory equivalent to an unsplit one
   depends on ``actor.loss_agg_mode``, because each mode normalizes by a
   different quantity. Splitting preserves the token count but multiplies the
   row count by ``N``:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - ``loss_agg_mode``
        - Normalizes by
        - Weight for an N-segment trajectory
      * - ``token-mean`` (default), ``token-sum``, ``seq-mean-token-sum``
        - tokens
        - ``1.0`` (splitting is already neutral)
      * - ``seq-mean-token-mean``
        - rows
        - ``1.0 / N``

   verl therefore defaults every segment to ``1.0`` rather than guessing
   ``1 / N``: under the default ``token-mean`` mode a ``1 / N`` default would
   silently shrink the trajectory's gradient contribution by a factor of ``N``.
   When a multi-output loop stores segments without an explicit weight, the V1
   adapter logs a warning once per segment count so the choice stays visible.
   If you train with ``seq-mean-token-mean``, set ``loss_weight = 1 / N``
   explicitly on each segment.

Each list element is stored as an independent training row. Consequently,
``ppo_mini_batch_size`` continues to count stored rows, not logical
trajectories; expanding a trajectory into more segments increases the number
of rows and optimizer mini-batches. Training logs expose the applied weight
range and the segment-to-session ratio under
``training/trajectory/`` so experiments can keep this change explicit when
comparing update counts or throughput.

.. note:: Multiple outputs from one ``run`` call are supported by the V1
   TransferQueue adapter. They are intended for ordered segments of one logical
   trajectory, rather than an alternative spelling of ``rollout.n``.

Architecture Design
-------------------

.. image:: https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/verl-community/blob/main/docs/agent_loop_architecture.png?raw=true

A single PPO step contain two phase: rollout and train. In rollout phase:

1. PPOTrainer sample a batch from dataset and call ``AgentLoopManager.generate_sequences``.
2. AgentLoopManager ``wake_up`` all async LLM server instances, which will sync weights between inference engine(vLLM/SGLang) and training engine(FSDP/Megatron-LM).
3. AgentLoopManager split batch into chunks and send each chunk to ``AgentLoopWorker``.
4. AgentLoopWorker receive chunk and for each prompt, spawn a user defined ``AgentLoopBase`` instance, run ``run`` coroutine until end and get ``AgentLoopOutput``.

.. tip::
   AgentLoopWorker schedules multiple coroutines concurrently. If number of AgentLoopWorker equals batch_size, then each worker is response for one prompt.

In agent loop, when user need LLM generate response:

5. Call ``LLMServerClient.generate`` with prompt_ids.
6. LLMServerClient select a server instance with least request in first turn and send request to it. (In following turns, the request will be sent to the same server instance).
7. AsyncLLMServer receive a request, issue ipc/rpc with model_runner, and generate response. (There's slight differences between vLLM and SGLang, see below).

When all prompts in all AgentLoopWorker finish, AgentLoopManager gather results and return to PPOTrainer.

8. AgentLoopManager ``sleep`` all server instances, which will free kv cache and offload weights to CPU memory.

AsyncLLMServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AsyncLLMServer is the abstraction of LLM server with two types of generation api:

- `OpenAI chat completion <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat>`_: generate response for the given chat conversation.
- Token in token out: generate response ids for the given token ids.

We have officially supported vLLM and SGLang AsyncLLMServer, both of them implement the two api and are well tested.
Other inference engine should be easy to plug-in by implement the ``AsyncServerBase`` class.

.. code:: python

   class AsyncServerBase(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       async def chat_completion(self, raw_request: Request) -> JSONResponse:
           """OpenAI chat completion API.

           Args:
               raw_request (Request): raw json request
           
           Returns:
               JSONResponse: json response

           API reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
           """
           raise NotImplementedError

       @abstractmethod
       async def generate(self, prompt_ids: list[int], sampling_params: dict[str, Any], request_id: str) -> list[int]:
           """Generate response ids given prompt ids.

           Args:
               prompt_ids (List[int]): prompt ids
               sampling_params (Dict[str, Any]): sampling params
               request_id (str): request id

           Returns:
               List[int]: response ids
           """
           raise NotImplementedError


Chat completion vs Token in token out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
   The following conclusion is based on our recent experience and is still open to investigation and discussion.

Almost all agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, etc) call LLM with OpenAI chat completion api, and 
keep chat history as messages. So user may expect that we should use the chat completion api in multi-turn rollout.

But based on our recent experience on single-turn training on DAPO and multi-turn training on `retool <https://github.com/verl-project/verl-recipe/tree/main/retool>`_,
we found the token_ids from apply the final messages may not equal to the token_ids by concat prompt_ids and response_ids in each turn.

.. image:: https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/verl-community/blob/main/docs/multi_turn.png?raw=true

**Where does this inconsistency happened?**

First, the tool parser may alter the content. For example

.. code:: json

   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me call a <tool_call>...</tool_call> and get the result"}

After tool_calls extraction, the messages is like this:

.. code:: json

   {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me call a and get the result", "tool_calls": [{"name": "foo", "arguments": "{}"}]}

Encode the extracted message back is not equal to the original LLM generated response_ids.

Second,  the `decode-encode` may also lead to inconsistency: `Agent-R1 issue#30 <https://github.com/0russwest0/Agent-R1/issues/30#issuecomment-2826155367>`_.

**What is the impact of this inconsistency?**

This inconsistency is not a big problem for serving/agent system, but is critical to RL training.
It causes the trajectory deviate from the policy model distribution. We have observed that apply_chat_template
to the final chat history messages make PPO training not even converged in single-turn.

vLLM
^^^^

.. image:: https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/verl-community/blob/main/docs/async_vllm.png?raw=true

For vLLM, the Async LLM Engine is running in same process as the server, and ModelRunner is running in same process as FSDP/Megatron-LM workers.
Async LLM Engine communicate with ModelRunner through ZeroMQ. When server receive a request, it directly call engine to generate response_ids.

SGLang
^^^^^^

.. image:: https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/verl-community/blob/main/docs/async_sglang.png?raw=true

For SGLang, the Async LLM Engine is running in same process as FSDP/Megatron-LM worker-0, and it spawn multiple subprocesses as ModelRunner.
Also, Async LLM Engine communicate with ModelRunner through ZeroMQ. When server receive a request, it remote call the worker-0 and get response_ids.

LLMServerClient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLMServerClient serve as proxy to multiple AsyncLLMServer instances, provides:

- load balance: select a server instance with least request in first turn and send request to it.
- sticky session: bind request_id to server instance, so that the same request_id will be sent to the same server instance in following turns.

LLMServerClient is passed to ``AgentLoopBase.__init__``, whenever user want to interact with LLM in agent loop,
they can call ``LLMServerClient.generate`` to generate response_ids.

.. code:: python

   class LLMServerClient:
       async def generate(
           self,
           request_id,
           *,
           prompt_ids: list[int],
           sampling_params: dict[str, Any],
       ) -> list[int]:
           """Generate tokens from prompt ids.

           Args:
               request_id (str): request id for sticky session.
               prompt_ids (List[int]): List of prompt token ids.
               sampling_params (Dict[str, Any]): Sampling parameters for the chat completion.

           Returns:
               List[int]: List of generated token ids.
           """
           ...
